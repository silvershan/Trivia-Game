Problem addressed: to create a trivia game with a countdown clock.  When time expires, the score is automatically calculated and score is calculated based on: incorrect answers, correct answers, and # of unanswered questions

How solved: JavaScript was incorporated to do a countdown and to code the scoring of the game.  HTML and CSS were used for the appearance and user interface of the game.

Technical approach:  I began by creating the HTML with the divs that I would be incorporating.  After the basic HTML was set up, I began working through coding the Javascript.  If/else statements allowed for the score to be calculated if time were to run out.  I also created an array of possible answers in JavaScript and made a separate array for the correct answers.  Lastly, I added in CSS for a better experience for the user.
